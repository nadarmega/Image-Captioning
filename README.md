# Image Captioning with LSTM and CNN

## Overview

This project implements an image captioning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model generates descriptive captions for images, trained on a dataset of 8,000 images.

## Features

- **Image Feature Extraction:** Utilizes CNN (VGG16) for extracting features from images.
- **Caption Generation:** Employs LSTM to generate textual descriptions based on the extracted image features.
- **Dataset:** Trained on a diverse dataset of 8,000 images.
